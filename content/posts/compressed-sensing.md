[Lecture video](https://youtu.be/rt5mMEmZHfs), and what [Terrence Tao has to say](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/compressed-sensing-and-single-pixel-cameras/) about the topic.

The video is associated with this [textbook](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/KutzBook/KutzBook.html).
I came across the Coursera version of this course around 2013.
The data analysis section of this course seems to be motivated by signal processing.
The course has some overlap with Stanford's EE263 (linear methods).
